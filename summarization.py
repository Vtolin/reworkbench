"""
Whole-document summarization for journals, articles, and research papers.

Pipeline: a fast model (MAP_MODEL) extracts tagged bullet facts from the
document in batches ("map"), a mid-size model (REDUCE_MODEL) consolidates
duplicates across batches if there are too many to synthesize directly
("reduce"), then the heaviest model (SYNTHESIS_MODEL, gemma4 26B) writes
the final narrative summary from those bullets. Each stage uses its own
Ollama model tag from config.py (all on the same Ollama daemon).
In parallel, a deterministic
regex layer pulls percentages,
dates, sample sizes, and named data sources directly from the source
text - no LLM involved - so those specific facts are guaranteed correct
regardless of what either model does with the narrative.

Design notes (why things are built this way):

1. NO THIRD-PARTY SENTENCE-SPLITTING LIBRARY. An earlier version used
   pysbd to fix a real bug (naive regex splitting broke on "Eq. 4",
   "Fig. 5", etc.), but pysbd introduced two new problems: its cost
   scales worse than linearly with input size (benchmarked: ~1000
   sentences/159K chars took 18s - untenable on constrained hardware),
   and it treats PDF line-wrap newlines as sentence boundaries by
   default. The splitter here is a plain, dependency-free regex with a
   curated abbreviation list (see _ABBREVIATIONS) and an initials
   pattern (e.g. "H. S. Zheng" doesn't get cut at each initial). It's
   O(n), immune to line-wrap newlines (they're normalized to spaces
   before splitting, same treatment table-rows get), and gives exact
   character offsets for free from the regex match positions - no
   separate position-search step needed.

2. CHUNK-BOUNDARY STITCHING. Ingestion chunks the document with overlap
   (CHUNK_SIZE/CHUNK_OVERLAP in config.py). Extracting facts from each
   chunk's raw text independently means a sentence straddling a chunk
   boundary is broken before it ever reaches the sentence splitter - one
   chunk holds a truncated head, the next holds a tail starting
   mid-word. _stitch_chunks reconstructs one continuous text stream
   first by detecting the real overlap between consecutive chunks
   (not assuming a fixed length). The overlap-detection search window
   is derived FROM CHUNK_OVERLAP directly (see _STITCH_MAX_OVERLAP_SEARCH
   below), so it can't silently fall out of sync if CHUNK_OVERLAP
   changes later - this bit a plain hardcoded cap before.

3. STAGE-SPECIFIC CONTEXT/OUTPUT BUDGETS. Map, reduce, and synthesis
   each get their own NUM_CTX and BUDGET_RATIO (config.py) instead of
   one setting for everything. Map is bulk mechanical extraction and
   doesn't need a large context; giving it a smaller, dedicated ceiling
   (MAP_NUM_CTX) reduces the KV-cache footprint of the model server's
   most frequent call, which matters on VRAM-constrained hardware.

4. SEQUENTIAL BY DESIGN. LLM calls run one at a time, deliberately.
   Concurrent requests only help when the model server has genuine
   spare capacity (extra GPU compute, or VRAM for multiple simultaneous
   KV caches). On a single consumer GPU already under memory pressure
   from partial CPU offload, concurrent requests compete for the same
   scarce VRAM and can make things slower, not faster - confirmed
   against real hardware in testing (RTX 4050 6GB + qwen 7B/14B).

5. REFERENCE-SECTION FILTERING. Bibliography entries pattern-match as
   fake "dates" and "statistics" (page ranges, publication years,
   citation numbers) and used to leak into the verbatim-facts section
   with no filtering at all. Sentences are now dropped if either their
   resolved section name looks like a references/bibliography heading,
   or the sentence itself starts with a bracketed citation number
   (the dominant real-world reference-list format).

6. SURVEY-VS-STUDY DISTINCTION. The map prompt's Adopted-Methodology-vs-
   Literature-Review tagging assumed an empirical-study structure. For
   a survey/review paper - which is what most of what gets fed into a
   research assistant's "summarize" intent actually is - nearly
   everything described (LoRA, DPO, specific model architectures) is
   literature being surveyed, not something the document itself
   adopted. The prompt now says this explicitly, rather than leaving
   the model to guess from a single chunk's local context.

7. "STAGNANT, NO FURTHER ROUNDS QUEUED" IS SUCCESS, NOT A WARNING. The
   reduce loop checks whether each round meaningfully shrank the
   consolidated bullets; if a round doesn't help, it stops and hands
   off to the synthesis model immediately instead of burning further
   rounds for no benefit. This is the intended stopping condition, not
   an error state - logged as an informational message, not "[warning]",
   specifically so it doesn't read as something having gone wrong.

    "You are a meticulous research assistant. Write a thorough, well-organized summary of the following document.\n\n"

    "1. Document Type Adaptation:\n"
    "   - Empirical Research: Organize around Purpose, Methodology, Key Findings, and Conclusions.\n"
    "   - Survey/Review Papers: The document surveys OTHER researchers' work. Methods and models described belong to the literature being reviewed, NOT the document's own methodology. Organize by themes/models reviewed.\n"
    "   - Legal (Indonesian putusan/court decision): Organize around Duduk Perkara (facts, parties, procedural posture), Pokok Perkara (the issues/claims), Dasar Hukum (the governing rules - cite the exact Pasal/ayat and statutes), Pertimbangan Hukum (the court's legal analysis and reasoning), and Amar Putusan (the ruling/holding). Preserve Pasal and ayat citations exactly.\n"
    "   - Legal (common-law judgment): Organize around Facts, Procedural History, Issue, Rule, Analysis/Application, and Conclusion.\n"
    "   - General: Organize around main arguments, themes, and conclusions.\n"
    "2. Rigorous Attribution: keep quotes, stats, and claims strictly attached to the exact speaker/source/entity named.\n"
    "3. Always include a 'Limitations / Caveats' section if the document discusses limitations, risks, challenges, uncertainties, or future work.\n"
    "4. Write equations and statistics in plain readable text (e.g. 't(38) = 0.12, p = 0.91') - NEVER use LaTeX delimiters ($ or $$) or [THIS WORK]/[CITED] tags."
)

MAP_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a factual academic extraction assistant analyzing a section of a document.\n\n"
    "Your task is to extract EVERY important, explicitly supported fact, mathematical formula, "
    "definition, methodological detail, quantitative result, limitation, caveat, and future-work "
    "statement from the provided text.\n\n"

    "CORE PRINCIPLES:\n"
    "- Be exhaustive but strictly faithful to the source.\n"
    "- Do not infer, speculate, paraphrase beyond what is necessary for clarity, or add information "
    "that is not explicitly supported by the text.\n"
    "- Preserve technical meaning, terminology, mathematical notation, and quantitative details.\n"
    "- If the text is ambiguous, preserve the ambiguity rather than resolving it through inference.\n\n"

    "EXTRACTION RULES:\n"

    "1. OUTPUT FORMAT:\n"
    "- Output ONLY bullet points using the format '- Fact'.\n"
    "- No introductory prose, headings, summaries, conclusions, or commentary.\n"
    "- One distinct fact per bullet.\n"
    "- Do not combine unrelated facts into a single bullet.\n"
    "- Sub-bullets may be used only when necessary to preserve the structure of a single fact.\n\n"

    "2. FACTUAL FIDELITY:\n"
    "- Extract every important fact explicitly stated in the text.\n"
    "- Keep exact numbers, percentages, dates, sample sizes, measurements, thresholds, "
    "names, terminology, and other quantitative details.\n"
    "- Do not round, normalize, reinterpret, or silently correct values.\n"
    "- Preserve stated causal relationships and correlations exactly as described.\n"
    "- Do not introduce relationships between entities unless the relationship is explicitly stated.\n"
    "- For example, only state that 'X supervised Y', 'X caused Y', or 'X was developed by Y' "
    "if the source explicitly establishes that relationship.\n\n"

    "3. ATTRIBUTION & SOURCE OWNERSHIP:\n"
    "Clearly distinguish the document author's own contributions from cited or previously "
    "published work.\n"
    "- Use [THIS WORK] for the author's own proposed method, model, algorithm, experiment, "
    "proof, analysis, result, finding, contribution, or conclusion.\n"
    "- Use [CITED] for findings, methods, theories, claims, datasets, algorithms, or conclusions "
    "attributed to prior literature or other sources.\n"
    "- If attribution is explicitly stated but ownership cannot be confidently classified, "
    "preserve the attribution without guessing.\n"
    "- When useful, identify the cited author, study, or source exactly as stated.\n"
    "- Do not treat a citation appearing after a sentence as proof of authorship unless the text "
    "actually attributes the claim to that source.\n"
    "- Skip bare citation/reference lists that contain no attached finding, method, or claim.\n\n"

    "4. MATHEMATICAL & TECHNICAL EXTRACTION:\n"
    "- Preserve mathematical equations, formulas, objective functions, constraints, and "
    "mathematical relationships exactly whenever possible.\n"
    "- Use standard LaTeX formatting: $...$ for inline mathematics and $$...$$ for display equations.\n"
    "- Preserve variable names, subscripts, superscripts, operators, constants, indices, "
    "conditions, and domains.\n"
    "- Explicitly extract definitions of variables and parameters when provided.\n"
    "- Preserve stated assumptions and mathematical conditions.\n"
    "- Do not simplify, derive, or algebraically transform equations unless the transformation "
    "is explicitly present in the source.\n\n"

    "5. METHODOLOGY & ALGORITHMIC RIGOR:\n"
    "- Extract the methodology, experimental design, procedures, algorithms, architectures, "
    "pipelines, and implementation details described in the text.\n"
    "- Preserve exact algorithm names, model names, dataset names, software/tools, versions, "
    "hyperparameters, training settings, evaluation protocols, and other technical specifications.\n"
    "- Extract loss functions, optimization objectives, evaluation metrics, baselines, "
    "comparisons, and statistical procedures when stated.\n"
    "- Preserve exact parameter values and configurations.\n\n"

    "6. RESULTS & QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE:\n"
    "- Extract every reported result that is relevant to the document's claims.\n"
    "- Preserve exact metrics, scores, percentages, confidence intervals, error rates, "
    "sample sizes, performance values, and statistical significance values.\n"
    "- Include comparisons between methods or groups when explicitly reported.\n"
    "- Do not infer statistical significance, practical significance, superiority, or causality "
    "unless the text explicitly states it.\n\n"

    "7. DEFINITIONS & CONCEPTS:\n"
    "- Extract explicit definitions of terms, concepts, variables, models, techniques, "
    "frameworks, and categories.\n"
    "- Preserve important distinctions between closely related concepts.\n"
    "- If the document defines a term in a specific or nonstandard way, preserve that definition "
    "rather than replacing it with a generic definition.\n\n"

    "8. LIMITATIONS, CAVEATS & FAILURE MODES:\n"
    "- ALWAYS extract explicitly stated limitations, caveats, assumptions, risks, weaknesses, "
    "failure modes, edge cases, sources of error, threats to validity, and conditions under "
    "which a method or finding may not hold.\n"
    "- Do not omit negative or contradictory findings merely because they are less prominent.\n"
    "- Preserve the conditions and scope associated with each limitation.\n\n"

    "9. FUTURE WORK:\n"
    "- Explicitly extract proposed future work, unresolved problems, recommended improvements, "
    "open questions, and directions for further research.\n"
    "- Distinguish proposed future work from work that has already been completed.\n\n"

    "10. NEGATIVE & NULL FINDINGS:\n"
    "- Extract statements indicating that an effect was absent, a hypothesis was unsupported, "
    "a method failed, a comparison showed no meaningful difference, or an expected result "
    "was not observed.\n"
    "- Never omit a finding simply because it is negative or inconclusive.\n\n"

    "11. ENTITY & RELATIONSHIP PRECISION:\n"
    "- Only state relationships between named entities when explicitly supported by the text.\n"
    "- Do not infer authorship, institutional affiliation, supervision, funding, ownership, "
    "causation, collaboration, or chronological relationships from context alone.\n"
    "- Keep entity names exactly as provided whenever practical.\n\n"

    "12. SOURCE BOUNDARY:\n"
    "- Extract only information contained in the provided section.\n"
    "- Do not use outside knowledge to fill gaps or correct the document.\n"
    "- Do not hallucinate missing values, equations, citations, authors, methods, or conclusions.\n"
    "- If a referenced concept is mentioned without explanation, record only what the text states "
    "about it rather than reconstructing its meaning from external knowledge.\n\n"

    "FINAL QUALITY CHECK:\n"
    "Before producing the answer, verify that you have captured:\n"
    "- all key facts and claims;\n"
    "- all mathematical formulas and variable definitions;\n"
    "- all methodologies, algorithms, and technical parameters;\n"
    "- all quantitative results and metrics;\n"
    "- [THIS WORK] versus [CITED] attribution where supported;\n"
    "- all definitions and conceptual distinctions;\n"
    "- all limitations, caveats, assumptions, and failure modes;\n"
    "- all negative/null findings;\n"
    "- all explicitly stated future work;\n"
    "- and all important conditions or scope restrictions.\n\n"

    "Output ONLY the extracted bullet points."

INTERMEDIATE_REDUCE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a factual consolidator. Merge and deduplicate the extracted bullet points below.\n\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "1. Output ONLY bullet points. Do NOT write paragraphs or prose.\n"
    "2. Keep specific speaker/source names strictly attached to their exact claims - do not fold two different sources' claims into one bullet unless both sides literally said the same thing.\n"
    "3. Preserve statistics, percentages, sample sizes, dates, and cohort counts exactly as given. Never round, drop, or merge two cohorts' numbers into one.\n"

    "- General: Organize around main arguments, themes, and conclusions.\n\n"

    "1. Speaker & Source Precision: group findings by Speaker/Source, and do not state or imply a relationship between two named entities unless it was explicitly given in the notes.\n"
    "2. Deduplication & Hierarchy: do NOT repeat themes across multiple sections - each finding appears in exactly ONE relevant section. ALWAYS include 'Limitations / Caveats' if any such notes exist, even if brief."
