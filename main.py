Academic Thesis / Legal Research RAG Assistant - CLI entry point.

below):
  User Query -> Query Understanding -> Intent?
    -> page-specific       -> Filter Resolution -> Direct Chunk Fetch

    the OS for a brief moment afterward. The original code called
    shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=True) exactly once and moved on

    file could be silently left behind, and the *next* index build would
    write fresh data alongside those stale leftovers in the same
