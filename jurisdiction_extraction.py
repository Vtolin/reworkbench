Jurisdiction extraction (best-effort metadata for filtering).

Unlike publication year (a clean 4-digit pattern) or section headings
(a font-size/boldness signal), jurisdiction is genuinely an open-ended
language-understanding problem - "which court decided this" isn't a fixed
format the way a date is. This module takes the same approach as the rest
of this pipeline's metadata extraction anyway: a deterministic, ingestion-
time keyword/pattern pass over the first page, rather than an LLM call.

That's a real tradeoff, not a free lunch - a keyword table will always be
incomplete, and this one only covers commonly-cited English-speaking and
international courts. It will miss courts not in the table, and a
document with none of these signals just gets jurisdiction=None (the same
graceful-degradation pattern as year/section/pinpoint). But it keeps
ingestion fast, deterministic, and independent of the model server being
reachable at index time - consistent with how heading/year detection were designed
- and it's straightforward to extend: add a (pattern, label) pair to
_JURISDICTION_PATTERNS below for any court missing from the list.

Worth knowing: plain keyword search (the BM25 half of hybrid retrieval)
already surfaces court-name mentions to some extent, since if a chunk's
text literally contains "Court of Appeal", a query mentioning "Court of
Appeal" will tend to rank it higher. What this module adds on top is the
ability to definitively FILTER to only one jurisdiction's documents
(rather than just rank them higher), and to show jurisdiction in
citations/exports.
