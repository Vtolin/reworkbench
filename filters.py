    Chroma's metadata `where` filter does NOT support `$contains`, so
    substring matching is done in Python, then turned into an exact-match
    $in list for Chroma.

    A naive substring check has a sneaky bug for numbered filenames:
    "journal1" IS a plain substring of "journal10.pdf", "journal11.pdf",
    etc. Typing `filter: journal1 | ...` would silently pull in every
    journal1X file too. The fix only applies when the search term itself
    ends in a digit (that's the exact situation where a longer number could
    be mistaken for it) - a purely alphabetic term like "journal" is left
    free to broadly match "journal1.pdf", "journal55.pdf", and so on, since
    that broad-prefix behavior is intentional and useful.

    Matching is done on normalized text (see _normalize) so "journal 4",
    "journal_4", and "journal4" are all treated as the same target.

    If nothing matches by filename, falls back in order to:
      1. Publication year (e.g. "2021"), if `doc_years` is given and the
         term looks like a bare 4-digit year.
      2. Jurisdiction (e.g. "australia" matching "Australia (High Court)"),
         if `doc_jurisdictions` is given - substring match, case-insensitive.

    Jurisdiction matching is EXPLICIT-only (this function, not the implicit
    auto-detect below) - see detect_implicit_doc_filter's docstring for why
    jurisdiction names aren't auto-scanned from free-form question text.

    Scans the query for natural mentions of indexed document names - e.g.
    "journal5", "journal 5", or "journal5.pdf" - without requiring the
    explicit 'filter:' syntax. Also recognizes a bare publication year
    (e.g. "what does the 2021 paper say") when `doc_years` is given, since
    sequential filenames don't encode year at all.

    Deliberately does NOT auto-scan for jurisdiction mentions the way it
    does for years - "what happened in Australia" as an ordinary question
    would incorrectly narrow retrieval to Australian-sourced documents
    only. A year is an unambiguous 4-digit token; a jurisdiction name is
    an ordinary word/phrase that appears in all kinds of unrelated
    sentences, so jurisdiction filtering is explicit-only (build_source_filter,
    via 'filter: australia | ...' or 'compare:').

    Two safeguards on the filename side:

    1. Restricted to filenames containing at least one digit (journal5,
       paper12, study_2023, ...). Without this, a document named something
       like "study.pdf" or "review.pdf" would silently hijack every
       question that happens to use the ordinary English word "study" or
       "review" - which, in academic writing, is most of them. Descriptive,
       non-numbered filenames can still be targeted explicitly with
       'filter: <name> | ...'.

    2. All matching uses \\b word boundaries, so "journal1" can never
       accidentally match inside "journal10" (a plain substring check
       would, since "journal1" literally IS a substring of "journal10").

    Collects every distinct document mentioned rather than stopping at the
    first hit, so "compare journal5 and journal9" retrieves both - and a
    year match is unioned in alongside any filename matches rather than
    replacing them.
