"""
Pinpoint citation detection: finding the specific-provision markers legal
writing uses to cite a precise point in a source, so citations can point
past the page number to the actual locator - PDF page numbers are a
rendering artifact, not a real citation target in either tradition below.

Two different conventions are detected, kept deliberately separate rather
than merged into one numbering system (an article number and a judgment
paragraph number are different things - collapsing them could produce a
nonsensical range like "paragraphs 5-42" out of an unrelated Pasal 5 and
paragraph [42]):

  - Common-law judgment paragraphs: bracketed ([42], the dominant UK/
    Commonwealth/international convention) or pilcrow/spelled-out
    (¶ 42, para. 42, paragraph 42).
  - Civil-law statute articles (Indonesia and other civil-law systems):
    "Pasal N" (Article N), optionally with "ayat (M)" (paragraph/clause M)
    - e.g. "Pasal 5 ayat (2)".

Both are deliberately conservative. A bare leading number ("42. The
claimant submits...") is NOT treated as a judgment-paragraph marker, even
though some judgments use it - on its own it's indistinguishable from an
ordinary numbered list, a statute subsection, or heading_detection.py's
own numbered-heading convention without more context than a single chunk
provides. Multiple distinct Pasal numbers found in one chunk are listed
rather than paired with a specific ayat, since associating the right ayat
to the right Pasal reliably would need positional analysis this
chunk-level heuristic doesn't attempt.

Every chunk gets tagged with a 'pinpoint' metadata string if either
convention was found - Pasal/ayat takes priority if both somehow appear
in the same chunk, since the other convention is far less likely to occur
in the same document. No markers found -> no 'pinpoint' key at all,
falling back to the page number, same graceful-degradation pattern as
section/year/jurisdiction detection elsewhere in this pipeline.
